On the Internet, the line between news and opinion becomes blurred in terms of content and form. In this sense, the processes of news diffusion on the Internet and online public opinion formation are integrated. We select one Korean example about the private tweet of a judge about government SNS regulation and analyze citation networks from one news/opinion to another news/opinion. By relying on social network analysis (SNA) methods, we examine how news/opinions diffuse and how they interact and influence each other¡¯s ideological frame within agencies sharing the same ideology and between agencies whose ideologies contrast. Our results show that public discourse on the Internet is clearly ¡®polarized¡¯ and ¡®fragmented¡¯ along political ideological lines. Additionally, our findings show that the winner is the conservative bloc because it succeeds in achieving within-bloc solidarity and ensures the resonance of news frames with the cultural values of Korean society. Implications for our findings in modern democracy are also discussed.
