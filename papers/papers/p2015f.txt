Numerous organization scholars point out that trust is crucial for well-functioning orga-nizations. However, trust in organizational settings could differ according to the objectsof trust. This study compares two conceptually different models: main-effect model andmediation-effect model. The main-effect model assumes that both interpersonal trust andinstitutional trust promote organizational commitment independently, but the mediation-effect model assumes that institutional trust is cultivated by interpersonal trust andincreases organizational commitment. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM)show that the mediation-effect model fits better than the main-effect model and that thestructural coefficients of the mediation-effect model are neatly interpreted by social sci-entific studies of trust. This study¡¯s findings have two important implications: First, thereseems to be sequential order between different types of trust in organizational settings.Second, interpersonal trust promotes organizational commitment only if it facilitates insti-tutional trust, providing an explanation for the inconsistent findings of previous studies.
