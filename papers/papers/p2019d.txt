This study investigated citizens¡¯ ambivalence toward female politicians and how valenced information about the politician helps them resolve their ambivalence, making them form polarized attitudes toward the candidate. Our study¡¯s participants felt stronger ambivalence toward a female candidate than a male candidate; those feeling stronger ambivalence reported more one-sided thoughts about and more extreme evaluation of the candidate, but only when the candidate was a woman. Citizens were also more easily persuaded by valenced information to resolve their ambivalence about the female candidate. On the basis of our findings, we discuss the politico-psychological process underlying citizens¡¯ ambivalence toward female politicians and how it is related with the gender-equal democracy.
