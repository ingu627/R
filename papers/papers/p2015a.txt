Recent political communication scholarship has examined whether social network sites (SNSs) contribute to political participation. Regarding SNSs¡¯ mobilization effect, however, mixed results have been reported. This study, relying on representative survey data from the 2012 South Korean general election, investigates interplay between three factors influencing electoral participation: (1) type of SNS use (i.e., political versus nonpolitical use), (2) user characteristics (i.e., past voters versus nonvoters), and (3) directionality of SNS messages (i.e., messages received from versus those sent to SNS friends). Results indicate SNSs¡¯ mobilization effect emerges when conditions are met. Voting intention is increased among past nonvoters
who use SNSs through political messages received from their SNS friends. Theoretical and practical implications of SNSs¡¯ mobilization effect are discussed.
