This study employs a uses and gratifications approach to explore how social network sites (SNS) users¡¯ attachment style influences SNS motives, SNS use, and related psychological outcomes, as well as the interrelationships of these factors. By modifying preexisting attachment styles, users were classified into four styles: (1) fearful-avoidant, (2) dismissive-avoidant, (3) secure, and (4) anxious-ambivalent. Findings show SNS use and SNS-related outcomes differ across attachment style groups, although SNS motive does not; and attachment style moderates the influences of SNS motive and SNS use on psychological outcomes. These findings imply potential consequences of SNS use can substantially differ depending on users¡¯ attachment style.
