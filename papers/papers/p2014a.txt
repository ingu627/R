It is easy to trace and compile a record of individuals' online activities, and cases of online privacy infringement (i.e., improper use of personal information) have been reported in advanced societies. Based on existing risk perception research, this study examines comparative optimism regarding online privacy infringement (i.e., users tend to believe privacy infringement is less likely to happen to oneself than to others) and its antecedents and consequences. Relying on large-scale online survey data in South Korea (N = 2028), this study finds: (1) comparative optimism is higher when the comparison targets are younger; (2) online knowledge and maternalistic personality traits increase comparative optimism mainly by influencing perceived risk to others, while prior experience of privacy infringement increases comparative optimism mainly by influencing perceived personal risk; and (3) comparative optimism is related to both greater adoption of privacy-protective behaviors and a higher level of support for government policies to restrict the use of online information. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings, along with potential limitations, are discussed.
