This study presents an automated content analysis of 2,379 abstracts of research articles published in four major journals from 1997 to 2017. A total of 45 topics were extracted using the structural topic model (STM), a statistical text analytic method that allows us to infer latent topics from abstracts and to conduct statistical significance tests regarding the relationships between topic prevalence and abstract features. We found that while some topics (e.g., public health or online social movement) demonstrate increasing trends, others (e.g., third-person effect and communication strategies) reveal decreasing trends; authors in non-US-based institutions are more likely than those affiliated with US-based institutions to focus on the societal consequences of media (e.g., agenda-setting effect or public deliberation). Additionally, interesting relationships were found between topic prevalence and the number of article authors (e.g., popular topics among multi-author papers are lab-based experiments or large-scale campaign studies). Finally, topic-journal associations were identified.
